# Jarvis – AI Voice Assistant

Jarvis is a Python-based voice assistant that listens to your commands, responds with AI-generated answers, and speaks them out loud. It uses OpenRouter (ChatGPT) for generating responses, SpeechRecognition for input, and pyttsx3 for voice output.

---

## Features

- **Voice-activated**: Starts on saying "Hey Jarvis".
- **Conversational**: Continues chatting until you say “exit”, “stop”, or “goodbye”.
- **Free AI API**: Works with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) – no OpenAI subscription needed.
- **Text-to-Speech Output**: Answers are spoken aloud using `pyttsx3`.
